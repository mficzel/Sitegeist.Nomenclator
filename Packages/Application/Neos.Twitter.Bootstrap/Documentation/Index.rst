==================================================
Neos.Twitter.Bootstrap - packaged as Flow Package
==================================================

Description
===========

This Flow Package brings Twitter's awesome Bootstrap framework into your project. The package contains Bootstrap and
jQuery together with a few nifty view helpers that will make your life easier.


Including Bootstrap in your Layout
==================================

Usually you'll add the bootstrap css and js files to your layout, so that they are included on each and every
view/template of your application.

Add the namespace declaration to the top of your layout::

	{namespace bootstrap=Neos\Twitter\Bootstrap\ViewHelpers}

Then add the following line to your <head> section at an approriate place::

	<bootstrap:include />

Options
-------
You can further tweak, what exactly and how Bootstrap is included by adding parameters from the following list:

version:
	If set to "3" the most current version of 3.x.x from Bootstrap is included. It could be pinned to a
	specific branch by using e.g. "2.1" which will include the latest version of 2.1.x
minified:
	defaults to "TRUE", can be set to "FALSE" to get the original files included during development
includeJQuery:
	defaults to "FALSE", can be set to "TRUE" to get jQuery included (useful if not already included)


Alternative way to include Bootstrap
------------------------------------

Instead of using the view helpers, you can also include the needed CSS or JavaScript files with the following lines
in your Fluid Template::

	<link href="{f:uri.resource(path: '2/css/bootstrap.min.css', package: 'Neos.Twitter.Bootstrap')}" media="screen" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
	<script type="text/javascript" src="{f:uri.resource(path: '2/js/bootstrap.min.js', package: 'Neos.Twitter.Bootstrap')}"></script>

Rendering Bootstrap-Styled FlashMessages
========================================

The FlashMessage-ViewHelper that ships with Fluid is fine, but the rendered FlashMessages are not rendered in the
"correct" HTML so that the Bootstrap CSS would make them nice and shiny. To get properly styled FlashMessages, use
the example Fluid-Snippet below by putting it in a partial within your own package (Note: At the moment, it's not
possible to access partials from within another package directly)::

	<f:flashMessages as="flashMessages">
		<f:for each="{flashMessages}" as="flashMessage">
			<f:if condition="{flashMessage.severity} == 'OK'">
				<div class="alert alert-success">
			</f:if>
			<f:if condition="{flashMessage.severity} == 'Notice'">
				<div class="alert alert-notice">
			</f:if>
			<f:if condition="{flashMessage.severity} == 'Warning'">
				<div class="alert alert-warning">
			</f:if>
			<f:if condition="{flashMessage.severity} == 'Error'">
				<div class="alert alert-error">
			</f:if>
			<a class="close" data-dismiss="alert" href="#">Ã—</a>
			<f:if condition="{flashMessage.title}">
				<h4 class="alert-heading">{flashMessage.title}</h4>
			</f:if>
				{flashMessage}
			</div>
		</f:for>
	</f:flashMessages>

Given you put the above code to Resources/Private/Partials/FlashMessages.html within your package, you can access
it in your template or layout with the following line::

	<f:render partial="FlashMessages" />

Navigation ViewHelper
=====================

The navigation view helper takes an array of menu items and renders a proper HTML structure out of that which is styled
by the Bootstrap CSS and enhanced with JavaScript. Often this view helper is added to the *.navbar* container to get an
application-wide navigation.

Define the menu items
---------------------

First you have to define your menu items in your controller and hand that array over to your view::

	$this->view->assign('navigationItems', array(
		array(
			'id' => 'navProjects',
			'label' => 'Projects',
			'items' => array(
				array(
					'label' => 'Show projects',
					'href' => $this->uriBuilder->uriFor('index', array(), 'Project')
				),
				array(
					'divider' => TRUE
				),
				array(
					'label' => 'New Project',
					'href' => $this->uriBuilder->uriFor('new', array(), 'Project')
				)
			)
		),
		array(
			'id' => 'navTasks',
			'label' => 'Tasks',
			'href' => $this->uriBuilder->uriFor('index', array(), 'Task')
		)
	));


Add icons to your menu items
----------------------------

If your menu items should show a nice icon next to them, you can use the Bootstrap Glyphicons for this. Just define an iconClass for a menu item and it will be shown right in front of the menu item::

	$navigationArray = array(
		'id' => 'navProjects',
		'label' => 'Projects',
		'iconClass' => 'icon-folder-open',
		'invertIcon' => TRUE
	);

You can find a list of all available icons and their class name at http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/base-css.html#icons

Setting invertIcon to TRUE will show them in white instead of black.


Adding the navigation items to all views
----------------------------------------

In case you want to have the same array globally for all actions, you can put the above array declaration like this::

	/**
	 * @param \TYPO3\Flow\Mvc\View\ViewInterface $view
	 * @return void
	 */
	public function initializeView(\TYPO3\Flow\Mvc\View\ViewInterface $view) {
			// Declare navigation items, will be available in all views from all actions if not overridden
		$navigationItems = array(PUT_YOUR_ITEMS_HERE);
		$view->assign('navigationItems', $navigationItems);
	}

Add the view helper to your layout
----------------------------------

Place the following line to the appropriate place in your template or layout:

	<bootstrap:navigation.menu items="{navigationItems}" />

Options
-------

classNames:
	By default, the generated <ul> will have the class "nav". By giving an array to this option that contains one or
	more class names, these classes will be used instead. ::

		<bootstrap:navigation.menu items="{navigationItems}" classNames="{0: 'nav', 1: 'your-custom-class'}" />
