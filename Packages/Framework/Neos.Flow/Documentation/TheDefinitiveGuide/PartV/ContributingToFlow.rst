Got time, a computer and a brain? Here is how you can help:

Report and Validate Issues
==========================

We don't code bugs, at least not on purpose. But if you find one, report it in
our issue tracker. But please help us to solve it by attaching a detailed description
of how to reproduce the issue. If you can provide a unit test that shows the bug,
this rocks big time.

* *Tasks:* Find bugs, describe them, reproduce them in a unit test
* *Skills needed:* Attention to detail, knowledge about PHP and PHPUnit is a plus

**Report bugs in the** `Flow issue tracker <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/issues>`_ **!**

Improve Documentation
=====================

A complex system like ours needs a lot of documentation. And despite the
complexity that documentation should be easy and fun to read. Right?

* *Tasks:* Proof read existing documentation, writing new documentation
* *Skills needed:* Writing skills and very good english are a must

Work on the Code
================

You found a bug? Have an idea for a missing feature? Found clever solution to an
open task? Just write the code and submit it to us for inclusion. Do it on a
regular basis and become famous. So they say.

* *Tasks:* Write clean and useful code. Bonus points for beautiful code :-)
* *Skills needed:* good to expert PHP knowledge, good understanding for OOP,
  knowledge about patterns and "enterprise architecture" is a plus
