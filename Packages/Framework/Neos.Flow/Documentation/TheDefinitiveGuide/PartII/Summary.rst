Next Steps
==========

This is the end of the Getting Started Tutorial. You now have a first
impression of what a Flow application looks like and how the most important
modules of Flow work together.

You now have two options for delving further into Flow programming:

-	Start completing the missing functionality on your own and while you
	do, read further parts of the Flow reference manual
-	Install the finished blog example and explore its code by reading and
	modifying it

If you can't wait to see the finished blog all you need to do is:

-	Delete your blog package (that is *Packages/Application/ACME.Blog/*) and then
-	Clone the Blog package from github: https://github.com/neos/Acme.Blog
