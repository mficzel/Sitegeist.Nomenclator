        # Example:
        #   includePaths:
        #     '/Public/': true
        #     '/Private/images/': true
        #   excludePatterns:
        #     '/node_modules/': true

        #   This will scan all of the Public Resources folder, as well as the 'images' sub-folder inside the Private
        #   Resources, except any 'node_modules' sub-folder in either one.
